Feature: As an administrator, I want to access the Alumni Events information with a given ID through API connection.

  Scenario: When a valid authorization information and correct data (id) are sent in the
  POST body to the api/alumniEventsId endpoint, the expected status code is 200, and
  the message in the response body should be "Success."
